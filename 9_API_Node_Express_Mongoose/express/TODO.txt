We will create a fake authentication interface that let the user ‘johndoe@gmail.com’ with the password ‘123456John’ to enter a home page
Create  a login form/ home / about us
Implement the fake  authentication middleware 
If the credential are wrong  return an error msg 
If the credential are valid grant access to the home page
In the home page will be a two links ‘Home’ and ‘About us’
Each link route to a different page (the content is your choice)
